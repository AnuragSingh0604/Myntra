This is a simple frontend project that replicates the homepage layout of the Myntra website using only HTML and CSS. It was created to practice core web development skills like working with layout, Flexbox, images, and styling.

The page includes a header with a logo, navigation links (Men, Women, Kids, Home & Living, Beauty, Studio), and a search bar. Below the header, there is a large promotional banner, followed by sections that display brand offers and shopping categories using images laid out in a responsive grid.

All elements are styled using custom CSS written in index.css, including hover effects on navigation links, spacing with Flexbox, and a modern font from the Assistant font family. The layout is responsive enough to adjust to different screen widths for a clean and organized appearance.

This project is intended for learning purposes, especially for beginners looking to improve their skills in structuring HTML, writing CSS, and working with image assets. It doesn't include any JavaScript or backend logic â€” it's focused purely on frontend layout and design.

Feel free to fork, clone, and experiment with it to strengthen your web development basics!
